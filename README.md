# Data Structures - (Python Implementationüíª)
This is my main reference for anyone who's looking to sharpen their skills with datastructures, feel free to take the work and 
change it up. There's a wide variety of topics I've implemented throughout my learning of datastructures and algorithms and love to
share the knowledge with the community. All the code is in Python as it's my goto language of choice but anyone is more than welcome
to use it as a practice guide or refresher on any topics you're not too strong in.

**All credit goes to - > Holczer Balazs (Udemy Python instructor)** I simply implemented what was taught in each lesson of the course and made a repository for those who want
quick implementations or other uses.

These are some of many structures to implement, feel free to mess around and make operations that take in a faster time and spcae complexity. 
If you look into each file you'll see that there's plenty of comments to understand what each line of code is doing. Enjoy using this source, again I don't take
