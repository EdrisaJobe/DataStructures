# Doubly Linked List
|Access| Search |Insertion head and tail|Deletion head and tail |Description |
|------|----------|-------|------------|------------|
O(n)    |O(n)     |O(1)   |O(1)       | Differs from a singly linked list because it has references that point both to the next node and previous node, the head is also pointing to null compared to a sinlgy linked list which the tail only points at null. Also, insertion and deletion at the tail is only O(1) due to having double pointers. Like a sinlgy, the main goal is to store items efficiently inserting and deleting.

 

# üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step

**The class Node**
```
# starting with a class Node, followed by the main LinkedList class
# Doubly | null <- [] <-> [] <-> [] -> null
class Node:
    
    def __init__(self, data):
        
        # data will take in whatever amount we give it
        self.data = data
        
        # we want each Node to reference to one another
        self.next = None
        self.previous = None
```
**The class DoublyLinkedList**
```
class DoublyLinkedList:
    
    def __init__(self):
        
        # head and tail are empty until a Node has been added
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
```
**Insertion at tail - O(1)**
```
    # inserts items at the end - O(1) runtime
    def insert_end(self, data):
        
        # set new_node to the Node object
        new_node = Node(data)
        
        # if the head is empty, we know the new_node is the head 
        if self.head is None:
            
            # set both the head and tail to the new_node
            # head points at first item, tail points at last item
            self.head = new_node
            self.tail = new_node
        
        # when there is at least 1 item within the list
        # we keep insering items at the tail
        else:
            # the previous node is the tail, we have to set the next node to be the new tail
            new_node.previous = self.tail
            self.tail.next = new_node
            
            # update the new_node to now be the tail
            self.tail = new_node
```
**Traverse forward - O(n)**
```
    # we can traverse the list in both directions | null -> [] -> [] -> [] -> null
    def traverse_forward(self):
        
        # the actual_node start from the head
        actual_node = self.head
        
        # loop when the actual_node is not empty, print out the actual_node
        while actual_node is not None:
            
             # .data is added to insert the items given
            print('%d' % actual_node.data)
            
            # move from node to node within the list forwards
            actual_node = actual_node.next
```
**Traverse at backward - O(n)**
```
# we can traverse the list in both directions | null <- [] <- [] <- [] <- null
    def traverse_backward(self):
        
        # the actual_node starts from the tail
        actual_node = self.tail
        
        # loop when the actual_node is not empty, print out the actual_node
        while actual_node is not None:
            
            print('%d' % actual_node.data)
            
            # move from node to node within the list backwards
            actual_node = actual_node.previous
```
**Function call: Inserting at end/traverse forward and backwards**
```
# function call
if __name__ == '__main__':
     listL = DoublyLinkedList()
     
     listL.insert_end(1)
     listL.insert_end(5)
     listL.insert_end(7)
     listL.insert_end(3)
     
     listL.traverse_forward() # null<-[1]<->[5]<->[7]<->[3]->null
     print("----")
     listL.traverse_backward() # null<-[3]<->[7]<->[5]<->[1]->null
```
